        <p>
            This project has two main objectives:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Make the information kept at <em>teseo</em> available as Open Data.
            </li>

            <li>
                Perform different analyses over the previous data to understand them.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.educacion.gob.es/teseo/">Teseo</a> is a Doctoral Dissertation database maintained by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mecd.gob.es/portada-mecd/">Spanish Ministry of Education</a>, keeping records for the dissertations defended in Spain since 1977. Teseo's website provides different forms to query the database, but makes it difficult for automatic processing.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to make it openly available to anyone, we scrapped all the information of the database and stored it in a relational database model. As most of the data is not validated (form fields accept any text string), there may be some errors related to the data, as we have automatically processed them in order to perform different analyses. Should you detect any error, you can find different ways to contact us on the <a href="{{ url_for('about') }}">about section</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Linked Open Data:</strong> All the information is also publicly published as <a target="_blank" href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked Open Data</a>, and queryable through the dedicated <a href="http://apps.morelab.deusto.es/teseo/sparql?default-graph-uri=&query=SELECT+COUNT%28%3Fs%29+AS+%3Fnumber_of_triples+WHERE+%7B+%3Fs+%3Fp+%3Fo+.+%7D">4 million triples</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of performed work involves:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Gender dissambiguation for authors and panel members. The process is automatized, so some names could be wrongly assigned a gender.
            </li>

            <li>
                Dissertations are tagged with different topics, from <a target="_blank" href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000829/082946eb.pdf">UNESCO's 6-digit nomenclature for fields of science and technology</a>. Topic distribution for different levels of granularity is available.
            </li>

            <li>
                People with the same full name, or with a high probability of being the same person (acronyms, abbreviations, etc.) are assigned to be the same person entity.
            </li>

            <li>
                All the data has been semantically enriched and published as <a target="_blank" href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked Open Data</a>, in order to allow machines to automatically process this dataset. We provide a <a href="http://apps.morelab.deusto.es/teseo/sparql">SPARQL endpoint</a> to query the available data.
            </li>

            <li>
                You can also <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='data/teseo_db.sql') }}">download a SQL dump</a> of all the data to work with it locally.
            </li>

            <li>
                Analyses are visualized through interactive charts to make them understandable by any user. The <span class="btn btn-info btn-xs"><i class="fa fa-info"></i>&emsp;Info</span> button on the top of each chart provides an extended explanation of the rendered data.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h1>The Sith Lords</h1>
    <p>Red Five standing by. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.</p>
    <h2>The Sith Lords</h2>
    <p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Don't underestimate the Force. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. What!?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</li>
        <li>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
        <li>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Battle for Endor</h3>
    <p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I call it luck. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</p>
    <h4>A New Hope</h4>
    <p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! What?!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</li>
        <li>Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</li>
        <li>Don't underestimate the Force.</li>
        <li>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.</li>
        <li>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>A New Hope</h5>
    <p>He is here. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>
